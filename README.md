# NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API

## Description

My NoSQL Social Network API is a Node.js application programming interface (API) which allows for multiple social network operations on model data. As of now, there are users, thoughts, reactions, and friends.

## Installation

clone code from github repository.

## User Story

AS A social media startup
<br>
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
<br>
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a social network API
<br>
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
<br>
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
<br>
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
<br>
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
<br>
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
<br>
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
<br>
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
<br>
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
